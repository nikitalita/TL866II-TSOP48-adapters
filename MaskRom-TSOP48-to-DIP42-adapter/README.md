This is adapter converts 5v Mask Roms in a TSOP48 package to a DIP42 footprint. Ideal for dumping with a TL866 II when used with an adapter like these:

The pinouts are compatible with a MX23C3210 TSOP-48 package, but others may work as well, I haven't checked.

Only supports word mode, only supports Normal-type (not Reverse-type) ROMs.
